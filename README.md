<h1>About Me</>
  <hr>
  <h4>I’m an uneducated man.  My time and choices are all that set me aside from anyone else.  I am the result of my choices.  For what I will be there is no true examination or expression that could measure with any certainty.</>
  
  <h4>My influence comes from a broad range of people who were deeply involved with different life choices that occasionally collide and imprint their values upon me.  All notwithstanding my alone time which I spend meditating, thinking, or reading.</>

  <h4>Of all the differing methods in which one is able to learn, I find it’s the quiet, one-on-one moments with the most engaging of souls which I have the honor to have met.  All the knowledge and experience I put forth is from observation and exploration of information that has come by me in happenstance and opportunity throughout my lifetime.  Ideas shared with me by strangers, coworkers, friends, family, and long dead thinkers whose legacies have survived ages tend to stand out the most.</>
